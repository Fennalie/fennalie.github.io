        <h4>1. SETUP:</h4>
        <p>- To start, prepare a deck of cards for the game called the "Equipment Stack". There are 50 cards in the box, with five different types / equipment symbols, representing helmet (blue), armour (black), shield (red), sword (white), and horse (a green horseshoe). Include one of each type of equipment card per player plus one. Unused cards may be returned to the box. The pictures on the cards and orientation of the cards are for humorous effect / thematic flavor and may be ignored; just pay attention to the symbols. </p>
        <p>- Shuffle the equipment stack and deal each player a hand of four cards. </p>
        <p>- Select a first player randomly, who will be the first "Claimant". </p>
        
        <h4>2. CLAIM:</h4>
        <p>
            The Claimant MUST play one card face down into a pile of cards known as "the Pack", and name a piece of equipment, essentially making a claim that this piece of equipment is NOT found within the pack. The claim can be an intentional bluff.
        </p>
        <h4>3. CHALLENGE:</h4>
        <p>The player on the Claimant's left goes next - let us call him/her the "Challenger". This player ALONE chooses whether to challenge. No other player is allowed to challenge. If this player chooses NOT to challenge, they become the next Claimant, and repeat step 2 (claim). The Pack will thus continue to grow in size, and claims will become more risky as the game progresses.</p>
        
        <h4>4. RESOLUTION OF CHALLENGE:</h4>
        
        <p>If a challenge is made, the facedown cards in the Pack are revealed. There are 2 possible results: </p>
        <p>- Claimant Wins / True Claim: The piece of equipment just named is NOT found within the Pack. The Claimant may give one card to the Challenger from the pack or from his/her hand, who will place it in front of himself/herself face up. </p>
        <p>- Challenger Wins / False Claim: The piece of equipment just named IS found within the Pack. The Claimant must take the card showing the equipment in question and place it in front of him/her face up. </p>
        
        
        <h4>5. STIFF UPPER LIP CLAIM / CHALLENGE:</h4>
        <p>After a challenge but before the Pack is revealed, the Claimant has the option to double down, re-stating their claim is true with the risk of increased penalties to the loser. This is called "Stiff Upper Lip". At this point, the Challenger has the option to withdraw the challenge - if so, they become the next Claimant, and repeat step 2 (claim). The Challenger may, however, accept the risk and continue with the challenge.</p>
        
        <h4>6. RESOLUTION OF STIFF UPPER LIP CHALLENGE:</h4>
        
        <p>To resolve the Stiff Upper Lip challenge, the facedown cards in the pack are revealed. There are 2 possible results: </p>
        <p>- Claimant Wins: The piece of equipment just named is NOT found in the pack (the claim is proved true). The claimant may give TWO cards to the challenger from the pack or from his/her hand, OR ONE of his/her face up cards. The challenger must place these in front of himself/herself face up.</p>
        <p>- Challenger Wins: The piece of equipment just named IS found in the pack (claim is proved false). The Claimant must take the card showing the equipment in question and place it in front of him/her face up. The challenger may give the claimant ONE additional equipment cards from their hand or from the pack (but not any face up cards). The claimant must place the card in front of him/her face up. </p>
        
        
        <h4>7. CHALLENGE PENALTY:</h4>
        
        <p>Once a type of equipment is in front of a player face up, that player may not mention that equipment when making their claim. </p>
        <p>No one can have more than one of each type of equipment in front of them face up. As a result, there may be rare situations where the winner of the challenge is unable to give 1 or more cards to the loser. </p>
        
        
        <h4>8. GAME CONTINUES:</h4>
        
        <p>After resolution of any sort of challenge, the remaining cards in the Pack are placed into a discard pile. Starting from the person to the left of the person who was forced to accept a face up card, each player in turn will draw from one card the Equipment Stack until they have a hand of four. If the draw deck is empty, shuffle the discarded cards and make up a new equipment deck. If there are still no cards in the equipment deck, players do not need to draw up to four cards. <br></p>
        <p>In the very rare event that all players are out of cards and no challenge has occurred, the Pack is discarded and each player in turn starting from the next Claimant will draw from one card the Equipment Stack until they have a hand of four (or the Equipment Stack and discard pile are empty)</p>
        
        
        <h4>9. GAME END:</h4>
        <p>As soon as any player has all five types of equipment in front of them face up, the game ends immediately and that player loses. All other players win.</p>
